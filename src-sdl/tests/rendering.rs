// What the screen actually gets.
//
// Written after Frank asked to stop being the test harness, and he was right
// to: three of the last four bugs — a backdrop painted over, a shader in the
// wrong dialect, every label drawn as a solid block — were invisible to
// `cargo test` and obvious in a screenshot. The suite was green through all of
// them.
//
// So this opens a real window, hidden, draws into it, and reads the pixels
// back. It is slower than a unit test and it needs a display, which CI has
// none of — so it skips there rather than failing. On a machine with a screen
// it is the difference between "the code compiles" and "the picture is right".
