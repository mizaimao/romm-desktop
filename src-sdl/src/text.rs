// Drawing words.
//
// The item docs/handheld-frontend.md calls "the least glamorous here and the
// one most likely to make the result feel cheap", and it is right. A webview
// wraps, ellipsises and falls back across fonts without being asked. Nothing
// below that does any of it for free.
//
// Four separate problems, and skipping any one of them shows:
//
//   * **Shaping.** Turning characters into positioned glyphs. Trivial for
//     English, not for anything with marks or joining forms.
//   * **Fallback.** A library with Japanese titles in it will ask for glyphs
//     no Latin face has. Drawing a row of empty boxes is the failure everyone
//     has seen and nobody reports as a bug, because it looks deliberate.
//   * **Line breaking.** Where a line may be split, which is Unicode's answer
//     and not "at spaces" — CJK has no spaces and breaks almost anywhere.
//   * **Ellipsis.** A title too long for its card has to stop somewhere, and
//     the somewhere has to be a character boundary in the original string, not
//     a convenient-looking gap between glyphs.
//
// `cosmic-text` answers the first three. The fourth is here, because where a
// name gets cut is a decision about this app rather than about Unicode.
