// Until now there was no way. The icon-set table ships with the app and names
// nine sets, the settings screen let you pick one, and nothing on the handheld
// could ever put the files where the picker points — they arrived only if the
// desktop app had downloaded them into a media folder the handheld happened to
// share. So the setting offered nine choices of which eight drew a blank
// screen, and there was no wrong thing to fix: the work simply was not written.
//
// This is that work. Same table, same URLs, same folder layout as the desktop's
// `fetch_icon_set`, so a set fetched here and a set fetched there are the same
// files in the same places.
//
// On a thread, with a blocking client. There is no async runtime in this front
// end and a few hundred small files is not a reason to add one — the thread
// reports progress down a channel and the settings screen reads it whenever it
// draws.
