// this table, and adding a setting is a row here rather than markup, a wiring
// function and a backend allowlist entry.

// a handheld — the window arrangement, the title bar, fit-to-window, and where
// RetroArch is installed, which on KNULLI is `/usr` and decided by the platform
// scheme. A setting that cannot do anything is worse than a missing one,
// because you try it.
