// The animated backdrop, as a shader.
//
// `ui/js/backdrop.js` is not CSS — it is WebGL2 with GLSL fragment shaders, a
// full-screen quad, and a handful of uniforms. On Mali-G52 the shading
// language maps to it one for one, which is why
// docs/handheld-frontend.md says not to leave this until last: it is the most
// portable thing in the whole front end, and getting it up early is what
// proves the GL context works on the device at all.
//
// The shader is the same source, with `#version 300 es` swapped for the
// desktop's `#version 330 core` — GLES 3.0 and GL 3.3 differ in the version
// line and in whether precision qualifiers are required, and in nothing else
// that this uses.
