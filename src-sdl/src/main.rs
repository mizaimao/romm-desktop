// The SDL front end: a window, a loop, and input.
//
// Phase one of docs/handheld-frontend.md task 3. There is nothing to look at
// yet beyond proof that the parts fit — what this establishes is the shape
// everything after it is written against:
//
//   * The window is **resizable**, and the layout answers. Not a fixed
//     backbuffer scaled up. On the handheld the size is settled once at
//     startup; on a desktop somebody drags an edge, and doing that is the
//     fastest way to find every place a pixel got hardcoded.
//   * Nothing is measured in pixels. A card is 150 *points*; `romm_desktop::
//     layout` turns points into pixels for whatever panel it lands on. The
//     moment a number in a view means pixels, that view has picked a screen.
//   * Input resolves through `romm_desktop::binds`, so a rebind made in the
//     desktop app is a rebind here. The pad's deadzones and repeat timings
//     come from `romm_desktop::padpoll`, which the webview only ever had a
//     copy of.
//
// It opens at 960x720 on purpose. That is the handheld, and living at 4:3
// every day is what stops the constrained case being a surprise at the end.

/// points either way and what is on screen here is what will be on screen
/// there. Getting that wrong is how a design that reads fine on a desk turns

/// requested at half this and the display's own doubling supplies the rest —
/// on a retina Mac that lands on 2560x1920 pixels, four device pixels per panel
/// pixel. It does not have to land exactly: `viewport` divides whatever
/// drawable it gets by 640, so the layout is a 640-point panel either way and

/// twelve pixels tall; at 2 it is 320x240 points and the same label is

/// One and a half, for the handheld. A 3.5" screen held at arm's length is not
