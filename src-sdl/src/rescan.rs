// Building the library from what is on the card.
//
// On the Mac there was always a cache: the desktop app had synced one from the
// RomM server long before the SDL front end existed, and every version of this
// front end has opened a file somebody else filled. The handheld arrives with
// nothing. It has 235 GB of ROMs on it and a `cache.sqlite3` with three rows,
// so the Library tab showed Ports, Tools and Emulators and no consoles at all —
// which is not a bug in the front end, it is a step nobody had written.
//
// This is that step, and it needs no server and no network: `esde::scan` walks
// the ROM directories the device already has, and the core map says which
// console each directory is. That is the same work `romm-desktop scan` does at
// a terminal, moved to where there is no terminal.
//
// On a thread, because it is thousands of directory reads and the screen
// carries on drawing while it happens.
