// about 786 KB once decoded, and the webview held every one it had ever drawn
// — 578 MB of a 671 MB process, measured on 2026-08-20. That is merely
// wasteful on a Mac. On a 1 GB handheld it is the whole machine.
//
// So this is bounded, and the bound is a count of textures rather than a
// count of bytes: every card on screen is the same size, so a texture is the
// same size as its neighbours and counting them is counting memory.
