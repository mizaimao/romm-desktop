// Drawing, on a context we own.
//
// SDL's 2D renderer went away with this file arriving, and the reason is not
// that it was slow. It creates its *own* GL context and gives no say in what
// version — on macOS a legacy 2.1 one, on Linux and Android a GLES 2.0 one —
// so a shader had to be written in whichever dialect it happened to hand back,
// and multi-pass work had to be interleaved with a batcher that does not know
// about it. The glass is render-to-texture and a blur, and that is not a thing
// to do through somebody else's batching.
//
// So: one context, asked for outright, GL 3.3 core on a desktop and GLES 3.0
// on the handheld. Both speak the same GLSL, so there is one dialect again.
// What is left is a couple of hundred lines that draw a rectangle with an
// optional texture on it, which is everything an interface of cards and words
// actually needs.
