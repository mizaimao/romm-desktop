# Keeping four copies of the library in step

Server, Retro SSD, Android and the Flip. This is what was done on 2026-08-29,
and — more useful — the things that turned out to be true about comparing ROM
sets, which are not obvious and cost time to learn.

## The server is the cleaned one

Frank spent weeks cleaning the RomM library. **The server is right by
definition.** Do not re-derive that; take it as given and bring the other
devices to it.

## How RomM hashes, which is not how you would guess

| file | what RomM stores in `md5_hash` |
| --- | --- |
| uncompressed ROM | md5 of the file |
| `.zip` | md5 of every member's bytes **concatenated in zip order** |
| `.7z` | something else again — neither the archive nor its contents |

`unzip -p file \| md5` reproduces the zip case exactly. Verified against
`3 Ninjas Kick Back (USA).zip` and a 22-member arcade set, `10yard.zip`.

For `.7z` neither side is comparable, so compare raw file md5 on both ends
instead.

This is why a first comparison said 4,921 files needed deleting and 4,922
copying: every zipped system mismatched because the archive was being hashed
rather than the ROM inside it.

## RetroAchievements hashes differently again

Per console, not per file. **NES strips the 16-byte iNES header**; SNES strips
a 512-byte copier header when present; GB/GBC/GBA/Mega Drive use the whole
file. RomM's `ra_hash` column is produced by `RAHasher`, RA's own tool, so it
is already correct — use it rather than computing your own. A raw `md5` of a
`.nes` will never match RA, and mistaking that for a bad dump nearly caused a
good ROM to be replaced.

`ra_id` in RomM is empty for almost everything, including Pokémon Red. That
means RomM has not resolved its hashes to games, **not** that the ROMs are
wrong. Ignore that column.

## "This ROM is not supported" is usually the core

RetroArch says that when the **emulator core** is not on RetroAchievements'
approved list — nothing to do with the ROM. mGBA is approved for GBA; `vba-m`
is not. Switching the Flip's GBA core to vba-m for an unrelated cheat fix made
every GBA game report unsupported.

Of the library, 46% of hashed ROMs have achievements, 37% are recognised
dumps with no achievement set authored, and 17% are unknown to RA.

## Hasheous is the authority on dump quality

`https://hasheous.org/api/v1/Lookup/ByHash/MD5/<md5>` aggregates No-Intro,
Redump and TOSEC. It returns the **canonical filename including dump flags**,
which is the actual verdict:

    Home Alone (1991)(THQ)(EU-US).gb                            clean
    Kat's Run - Zennihon K Car Senshuken (1995)(Atlus)(JP)[b3]  bad dump
    Ecco the Dolphin (1994)(Sega)(EU-US)[b2]                    bad dump
    Chase H.Q. (1991-03-08)(Taito)(JP)(en)[h]                   hacked

Being *absent* from RetroAchievements proves nothing — their coverage is thin
on Europe-only releases and revisions. Being flagged `[b]`, `[h]`, `[o]` or
`[f]` in TOSEC is proof.

RomM already talks to this service; no key is needed for lookups.

## Traps that produced wrong answers

**Multi-disc and multi-file roms.** A game can be one row on the server and
many files on a card: `.Final Fantasy VII (USA)/` plus a `.m3u`, or a folder
RomM marks `multi_file=1` such as `gba/Aftermarket`. Comparing filenames
deletes the parts. 24 of them were held back only because this was caught.

**Unhashed server rows.** 204 rows under `sfc/AdditionalRoms` have no md5 at
all. A hash-only comparison called their card copies orphans and would have
deleted 195 files. Always fall back to a name match before deleting.

**Basenames are not paths.** Listing with `basename` loses the subfolder, so
`gb/Aftermarket/Foo.zip` becomes `gb/Foo.zip` and every later operation misses
it. This cost two separate runs.

**Extensions belong to the destination.** The server may hold a game zipped
where a device holds it raw. Taking the server's *name* including its
extension renames a raw `.gg` to `.zip` — a file no emulator opens, and
`unzip -p` then reads it as empty so two such files hash identically and look
like duplicates. Take the name, keep the local extension.

**macOS adds junk.** `tar` and `7zz` on this Mac write `._` AppleDouble files
onto exFAT. 920 landed on the SD card and 10 in the SSD's ROM tree. On exFAT
some are not real files at all but the xattrs of a real one — `rm` fails and
`xattr -c` is what clears them.

**`scp` inside `while read` eats stdin.** The loop runs once and reports
success. Use `</dev/null` on every `ssh`/`scp` inside a loop. Also `rsync`
failed against this SSD every time with "unexpected end of file" where `scp`
worked.

## What a sync run actually has to move

A rename is four things, not one: the ROM, its `-image.png` artwork, its
`.srm`/`.state` saves, and its `gamelist.xml` entry. Renaming only the ROM
orphans the rest silently.

`gamelist.xml` is edited as text, never parsed and rewritten — it holds
scraped tags like `<cheevosHash>` that a rewrite would drop. Escape `&` when
inserting a filename, or the file stops being valid XML and ES reads nothing.

## Where it stands

Server, SSD and Android agree. The **Flip has not been touched** and is behind
by: 56 merged games, the Home Alone dump fix, the two Oddworld discs, and six
bad dumps still present.

Deliberately not done: compressing the 4,158 raw cart ROMs (~4.5 GB saving) —
it renames files, so it desyncs any device it is not done on.
