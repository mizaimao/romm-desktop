# A Wayland compositor on the Miyoo Flip

**Finding, 2026-08-25.** KNULLI on the Miyoo Flip ships a build of the Mali
driver with **no Wayland support and an old GBM ABI**, and that — not the
hardware, not the GPU, not the kernel — is why no compositor starts. Swapping in
a different build of *the same vendor driver* makes both Weston and Sway run,
with GLES 3.2, on the vendor stack. No Panfrost, no Mesa, nothing rebuilt.

This matters because a compositor is the thing WebKitGTK needs, and WebKitGTK is
the thing a Tauri build needs. The other half was already checked: Buildroot
carries webkitgtk 2.52.4 for aarch64 and its GTK3 path installs
`libexec/webkit2gtk-4.1/`, which is the API Tauri v2 requires.

## The symptom

Both compositors on the stock image fail, and they look like different faults:

```
weston: Failed to load module: /usr/lib/libweston-14/drm-backend.so:
        undefined symbol: gbm_bo_get_fd_for_plane
sway:   Segmentation fault
```

Sway's is a red herring twice over. It needs a seat manager, and the device runs
one (`seatd`, socket at `/run/seatd.sock`) — but `libseat` here has no `seatd`
backend compiled in, so `LIBSEAT_BACKEND=seatd` fails and only `builtin` works.
Given that, sway gets all the way to reading the display's EDID and then dies on
**the same missing symbol as Weston**, inside `libwlroots`.

## The cause

On this image GBM *is* the Mali blob:

```
/usr/lib/libgbm.so.1      -> libmali.so.1
/usr/lib/libEGL.so.1      -> libmali.so.1
/usr/lib/libGLESv2.so.2   -> libmali.so.1
/usr/lib/libgbm.so.1.0.0  -> libMali.so
```

Rockchip publishes libmali in many builds. The one here is the **GBM-only,
no-Wayland** build of an older release:

| | stock (`g13p0`) | `g24p0-wayland-gbm` |
|---|---|---|
| `gbm_bo_get_fd_for_plane` | absent | present |
| Wayland strings (`wl_display_`) | **0** | 14 |
| size | 43,388,472 | 56,358,648 |

`gbm_bo_get_fd_for_plane` arrived in Mesa 21.1. Weston 14 and wlroots 0.18 both
require it; this blob predates it. And with zero Wayland support compiled in,
even a client that got that far would have no EGL Wayland platform to bind.

Note what is *not* the cause: the kernel. `dmesg` reports
`Kernel DDK version g18p0-01eac0` while the userspace here is `g13p0` and the
one that works is `g24p0`. Both wiki and folklore say kernel and userspace must
be a matched pair; on this device a `g24p0` userspace ran fine on a `g18p0`
kernel.

## The fix

One file, from [ROCKNIX/libmali](https://github.com/ROCKNIX/libmali), which
mirrors Rockchip's builds:

```
lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libmali-bifrost-g52-g24p0-wayland-gbm.so
```

The blob is a mega-library: EGL, GLES, GBM and Wayland-EGL in one file, reached
through symlinks. So an override directory needs every name the system points at
it.

## Reproducing it

Nothing below is installed. It is `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for the processes started,
`/usr/lib` is untouched, and a reboot forgets all of it.

```sh
# 1. Fetch the blob (56 MB) and put it on the device.
curl -fL -o libmali.so.1 \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCKNIX/libmali/master/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libmali-bifrost-g52-g24p0-wayland-gbm.so
scp libmali.so.1 root@FLIP:/tmp/mali24/libmali.so.1      # password: linux

# 2. On the device, give it the names the system expects.
cd /tmp/mali24
for n in libEGL.so.1 libGLESv2.so.2 libGLESv1_CM.so.1 \
         libgbm.so.1 libwayland-egl.so.1 libMali.so; do
  ln -sf libmali.so.1 $n
done

# 3. Take the display from EmulationStation. It has a respawn loop, so clearing
#    its flag is part of stopping it.
emulationstation-standalone --stop-rebooting
/etc/init.d/S31emulationstation stop
while pidof emulationstation >/dev/null; do sleep 0.5; done

# 4. Run a compositor against the new blob.
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/wl-run; mkdir -p $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR; chmod 700 $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/mali24
weston --backend=drm-backend.so --idle-time=0 &

# 5. And a client.
export WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1
weston-terminal &

# 6. Give the screen back.
pkill -x weston; cat /dev/zero > /dev/fb0
setsid nohup /usr/bin/emulationstation-standalone >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```

For sway instead of Weston, the same but:

```sh
export LIBSEAT_BACKEND=builtin   # the seatd backend is not compiled into libseat here
export WLR_RENDERER=gles2
mkdir -p /tmp/swaycfg && printf 'exec sleep infinity\n' > /tmp/swaycfg/config
sway -c /tmp/swaycfg/config &
```

Two traps that cost time and are not obvious:

* **`weston --tty=1` is fatal on Weston 14** — `unhandled option`, printed
  *after* EGL has already initialised successfully, so the log reads like a
  graphics failure and is not.
* **`seatd-launch` refuses to start** when a seatd is already running
  (`Socket file found at socket path /run/seatd.sock`). Use the running one, or
  `LIBSEAT_BACKEND=builtin`.

## What it prints when it works

```
Loading module '/usr/lib/libweston-14/gl-renderer.so'
EGL version: 1.5 Bifrost-"g24p0-00eac0"
EGL vendor: ARM
EGL client APIs: OpenGL_ES
EGL features:  EGL Wayland extension: yes
GL renderer: Mali-G52
GL ES 3.2 - renderer features:  OES_EGL_image_external: yes
Using GL renderer
Chosen EGL config details: id: 1 rgba: 8 8 8 0 buf: 24 ... XRGB8888
```

and `weston-terminal` connects and draws.

## A dead end worth recording

Dropping **Mesa's** `libgbm` in front of the Mali driver — Debian trixie's
`libgbm1` 25.0.7, arm64 — gets past the missing symbol and then segfaults. GBM
and EGL have to be the same implementation: Mesa's `gbm_create_device` returns a
Mesa device and Mali's EGL reads it as its own. Half a stack is not a stack.

## Do the emulators still work on it?

Yes, as far as a log can say. Each core was run against a real game for a fixed
spell on both drivers, twice over — RetroArch cores first, then the standalone
emulators, which reach the driver directly rather than through RetroArch's GL
layer.

| | stock `g13p0` | `g24p0-wayland-gbm` |
|---|---|---|
| snes9x | ran | ran |
| mgba | 17 s | 17 s |
| pcsx_rearmed | 17 s | 17 s |
| mupen64plus-next | 14 s | 14 s |
| flycast (x3) | 14 s, clean | 14 s, clean |
| flycast standalone | GLES 3.2, Mali-G52 | GLES 3.2, Mali-G52 |

Every flycast run on both drivers passed its own `glBlitFramebuffer test
successful` check, which is the emulator probing a GL capability and getting a
working answer rather than merely failing to crash. The standalone build reports
`Vendor 'ARM' Renderer 'Mali-G52' Version 'OpenGL ES 3.2 v1.g24p0-00eac0'` — the
new blob, in use, by name.

Two things not to read into this:

* **One flycast run did segfault on the newer blob** during the first pass. It
  did not reproduce: three further runs on each driver were clean. Recorded
  because it happened, not because it means anything yet.
* **`mupen64plus` standalone fails on both drivers** with `not a valid ROM
  image` on a `.zip`. That is a ROM-format complaint, identical either side, and
  not a driver difference.

**What a log cannot tell you:** whether the picture was *correct* and whether
the framerate held. Every measurement here is from a terminal over SSH. A core
can render garbage, or run at twelve frames a second, and log nothing unusual.
Before the blob goes on permanently, somebody has to play something on it.

## Trying it without installing it

`scripts/flip-mali-shim.sh` stages the blob under `/tmp` on the device and
prints the line to run with it. `/usr/lib` is never written to, and a reboot
forgets the whole thing.
