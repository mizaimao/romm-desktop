# Total physical footprint of the app: the Rust process plus the WebKit helpers
# it spawned — and nothing else.
#
# Two ways of finding the helpers have already been wrong. Guessing `pid+8`
# missed them whenever anything else on the machine had opened a web view, and
# a run with no WebContent in it reads as 54 MB and looks like a triumph.
# Taking every WebKit process on the machine counted Safari's and read as
# 2,476 MB. So: the caller records which ones existed before the app started,
# and this counts the ones that did not.
#
# It also says when the count is not four. A silent miscount is the only way
# these numbers can lie, and they have lied twice.
