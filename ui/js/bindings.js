// from the comments around them.
//
// Two things this file still does, and both are about speed. It holds the
// resolved tables in a variable so the accessors stay *synchronous*: the
// controller poll runs inside requestAnimationFrame, 120 times a second on
// this display, and `padMap()` there cannot await anything. And it reloads on
// `bindings-changed`, because the settings window is a separate document —
// rebinding there changes the file, and this document has to be told.
