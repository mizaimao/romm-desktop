// The color of a game's box art, for the selection glow.
//
// One number per cover, worked out once and remembered. The cover is drawn
// into an 8x8 canvas and the 64 pixels are averaged — the browser does the
// scaling in the graphics driver, so the cost is one small draw call and 256
// bytes read back, not a walk over a 500x700 image. On this library that is
// under a millisecond per cover and never happens twice for the same game.
//
// Why a color rather than a border: a highlight in the game's own colors
// tells you which game is selected *and* something about the game, from the
// corner of your eye, without adding a single button or bar.
//
// ## Why the canvas is readable
//
// Reading pixels back from an image loaded off another origin taints the
// canvas and `getImageData` throws. Covers come through Tauri's asset
// protocol, which is a different origin from the page — but it answers with
// `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` set to this window's exact origin, so
// requesting the image with `crossOrigin = "anonymous"` satisfies the check and
// the canvas stays clean.
//
// That is a promise about someone else's code, so it is not assumed: the first
// SecurityError switches the whole feature off for the session rather than
// throwing once per cover. The interface falls back to the theme color, which
// is what it used before this existed.
