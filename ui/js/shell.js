// Where a view is drawn, and what the window looks like while it is.
//
// This exists so the layout is one decision rather than forty-three. Every
// screen used to set the top bar itself — hide Back, show Grid, show the zoom
// slider unless we are in list mode, set the title — six or seven imperative
// lines repeated in each of six functions. That is not merely repetitive: each
// copy states, in code, that this is a single-pane app with a back button.
// Changing the shape of the window meant editing every view that had an
// opinion about it, and they all did.
//
// A view now *describes* what it needs and hands over its content. This module
// decides what that means for the window that is actually on screen. A
// different arrangement — consoles down the left, games in the middle, the
// preview on the right, nothing hidden and no Back at all — is a different
// implementation of `enter` and `paint`, not a change to any view.
//
// Nothing in here knows what a console or a game is, and no view knows what a
// column is. That is the whole point of the split.
