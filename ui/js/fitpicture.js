// Draw a picture at the size it is actually shown, and let go of the rest.
//
// Measured 2026-08-22, and this is the whole reason the file exists: WebKit
// decodes an image at the *file's* resolution, not the size it is drawn at.
// Twenty of Frank's 1,280x960 miximages, drawn into 200x150 boxes, cost
// 10.9 MB each — against 2.6 MB each for the same boxes filled from 325x600
// files. Same tiles, same layout, four times the memory, and the only thing
// that differed was the file. Ninety cards of that is around 980 MB, which is
// the arcade screen and the whole problem. See `docs/memory.md`.
//
// So: fetch the bytes, decode them once, draw the result into a canvas the
// size of the box, and close the decoded copy. What stays in memory is the
// canvas — a 200x150 box at 2x is 0.24 MB — instead of the decoded file.
//
// **Nothing here writes.** The file on disk is untouched, still exactly the
// bytes that were downloaded, and it is still what the lightbox and the
// full-size views open. This changes what is held in memory, not what is
// stored.

/// Never enlarge. A 224x256 titlescreen in a 400px box should stay 224x256 and
/// let the box letterbox it, the way `object-fit: contain` does — blowing it up
/// would cost four times the memory to show exactly the same detail.
