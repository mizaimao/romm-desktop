// Every settings tab, rendered and wired the way the window does it.
//
// The other settings tests check that the markup contains a control. That is
// not the same as the tab working, and the difference was three live bugs that
// had been shipped for weeks:
//
//   * General wired a "reset keyboard" button that lives on the Control tab.
//     The lookup returned null, `.addEventListener` threw, and everything after
//     it in that pane — the wiring for every text field and toggle on the tab —
//     never ran. So editing the server URL or the library folder did nothing.
//   * Appearance called `cssColor()`, which was defined nowhere at all, so
//     wiring that tab threw partway through and the backdrop's own controls
//     were never connected.
//   * Both reset buttons called `closeSettings()` and `toggleSettings()`, which
//     were never imported into that module — a ReferenceError on click.
//
// None of them failed a test, because a pane that throws while being wired
// still contains all of its markup. This file wires the panes.
