// Do the settings panes' classes have any styling at all?
//
// The settings window is its own document — settings.html, `#pane`, styled by
// settings.css. The library window is index.html, styled by style.css. Writing
// a pane's rules into the wrong one fails *silently*: the markup renders, the
// behaviour works, every test passes, and the elements simply come out with
// the browser's default look. That is how the Icon sets tab shipped with its
// screenshots at their natural 1280px width — the rules were in style.css
// under `#settings`, an id that exists in neither document.
//
// jsdom has no layout and no cascade, so nothing here can check what a rule
// *does*. What it can check is that a rule exists at all, in the file the
// window loads, which is the whole of the mistake being guarded against.
