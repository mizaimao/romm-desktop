// The claim this file has to keep honest is that the views no longer know what
// the window looks like. That was not true before: every screen set the top bar
// itself — hide Back, show Grid, show the zoom slider unless we are in list
// mode — six or seven imperative lines repeated in each of six functions, each
// copy stating in code that this is a single-pane app with a back button.
// Forty-three of those lines, and every one of them would have had to change
// for a three-column layout.
//
// So the test builds a three-column skeleton — consoles down the left, games
// in the middle, preview on the right, no Back button at all because nothing
// is ever replaced — points the shell at it, and drives the ordinary view code
// against it. Nothing in ui/js knows this file exists.
