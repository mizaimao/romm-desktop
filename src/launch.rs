//! Everything that has to happen between "play this" and spawning RetroArch.
//!
//! This existed three times — once in the CLI, once in the TUI, once in the
//! Tauri commands — and drifted every time it was touched. Two bugs came
//! directly out of that: per-platform shaders were wired into one path and
//! silently absent from the others, and the `--set-shader` fix later had to be
//! applied three times. The incomplete-playlist guard never made it out of the
//! CLI at all, so the GUI would hand a stub `.m3u` to the emulator and fail
//! somewhere unhelpful.
//!
//! One planner, three thin callers. Adding a step is now one edit.
