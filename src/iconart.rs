//! Per-system artwork from an ES-DE theme, one file at a time.
//!
//! Themes name their pictures for the ES-DE system — `snes.svg`, `3do.png` —
//! and put them somewhere different in every repository. `data/icon-set-art.toml`
//! records where, surveyed from the repositories themselves.
//!
//! ## Why this exists at all
//!
//! The Icon sets tab first previewed a theme with the author's own screenshots,
//! which show the theme's whole interface — its menus, its game grids, its
//! backgrounds. None of that is what this app takes from a theme. It takes the
//! console pictures and nothing else, so the preview was advertising something
//! the download does not deliver.
//!
//! Showing the real console pictures instead means fetching them, and fetching
//! them used to mean cloning the repository: hundreds of megabytes to keep a
//! few hundred kilobytes, which is affordable once and impossible nine times
//! over for a tab whose entire purpose is looking before you download.
//!
//! Individual files over raw HTTP cost a few kilobytes each. That is what makes
//! previewing nine sets, and installing one, the same cheap operation.
