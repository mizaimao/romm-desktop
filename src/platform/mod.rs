// What differs between the devices this app runs on.
//
// The axis of difference is the *device*, not the front end. SDL-vs-webview is
// a rendering choice and answers none of these questions:
//
//   1. Where does the library live?
//   2. Where does RetroArch keep its own files?
//   3. Which system directories mean what, and which are not ours?
//   4. How do brightness and battery work?
//
// Before this module those were answered by `#[cfg(target_os = …)]` scattered
// across `src/`, which cannot express the targets that matter. KNULLI *is*
// `target_os = "linux"` while being nothing like desktop Linux, and Android
// falls through the same `not(any(macos, windows))` branch. Both compiled and
// both behaved wrong.
//
// Selection is by Cargo feature, with the host's `target_os` as the fallback
// when no scheme is named — so an ordinary build is unchanged and the two
// schemes `target_os` cannot reach are opt-in.
