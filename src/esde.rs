//! Reading a local ES-DE library instead of a RomM server.
//!
//! The app was built around a remote server: sync metadata, download ROMs,
//! fetch artwork. An ES-DE install on a local disk already has all three, so
//! nothing needs downloading — only indexing.
//!
//! ES-DE's layout, and the one trap in it:
//!
//! ```text
//! <roms>/<system>/<game files>
//! <esde>/gamelists/<system>/gamelist.xml        names, genre, players, rating
//! <esde>/downloaded_media/<system>/<type>/<game stem>.<ext>
//! ```
//!
//! **`<system>` is ES-DE's name, not a RomM slug** — `dreamcast` vs `dc`,
//! `neogeo` vs `neogeoaes`, `megadrive` vs `megadrive`. The mapping already
//! exists in `data/esde-core-map.json`, which is what makes this cheap: the
//! same file that tells us which core runs a platform also tells us which
//! ES-DE system feeds it.
