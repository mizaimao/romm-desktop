// Chinese, Japanese and Korean share code points for characters whose correct
// *shapes* differ — 直, 骨, 話, 令 are drawn differently in each, and a reader
// of one sees the other immediately. A font chosen for covering the script
// rather than for the language draws one of them in another's forms. It stays
// perfectly legible and merely looks foreign, which is why nobody reports it.
//
// EmulationStation's answer, on the very handheld this targets, is
// `DroidSansFallbackFull.ttf` — Android's single pan-CJK fallback, built on
// simplified Chinese forms and used for all three. That is the pragmatic
// answer, and it is why Japanese titles look subtly wrong in every one of
// these front ends. `fonts-noto-cjk` is installed there too and has proper
// per-language variants, so the only thing missing is knowing which to ask
// for.
//
// Which the text answers by itself. Kana means Japanese; hangul means Korean;
// Han alone means Chinese, and which Chinese is a question about the
// characters used. No metadata, no region field, no configuration.
