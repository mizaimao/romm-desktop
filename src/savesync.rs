//! Save synchronisation: the glue between [`crate::saves`] and [`crate::api`].
//!
//! Both ends were already written and neither was ever called, so save sync has
//! never run. This module is the missing middle: scan the RetroArch save tree,
//! tell the server what we have, and carry out whatever it asks for.
//!
//! Runs automatically either side of a launch — pull before, push after — and
//! on demand through `sync-saves`. `[saves] auto_sync` turns the automatic half
//! off.
//!
//! This was deliberately manual for a long time, on the grounds that a save is
//! the one thing here that cannot be re-downloaded if it goes wrong. That was
//! really an argument against automatic sync *without a way back*: every
//! overwrite now copies the previous file into a rotating backup first (see
//! [`crate::savebackup`]), so a bad outcome is recoverable rather than final.
//!
//! A conflict is never resolved silently. When both sides changed since the
//! last sync, nothing is written and the launch is refused until the user says
//! which copy to keep — playing on top of a save whose ownership is unsettled
//! is how the loser gets overwritten for good on the way back out.
