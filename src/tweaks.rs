//!
//! Distinct from `shaders.rs` because RetroArch keeps these somewhere else
//! entirely: core options are **not** part of `retroarch.cfg`, so they cannot
//! be delivered through `--appendconfig`. They live in
//! `config/<Core>/<Core>.opt`, and a remap in `config/remaps/<Core>/<Core>.rmp`.
//!
//! Rather than edit those — they are the user's own RetroArch settings — the
//! launch config redirects both locations into the project's `library/`
//! folder:
//!
//! ```text
//! global_core_options      = "true"
//! core_options_path        = <library>/retroarch/core-options.cfg
//! input_remapping_directory = <library>/retroarch/remaps
//! ```
//!
//! Verified against the running emulator: with those set, RetroArch reads and
//! rewrites *our* file and leaves the user's `FCEUmm.opt` byte-identical.
//! `core_options_path` alone is not enough — the per-core file wins unless
//! `global_core_options` is also on.
//!
//! Because the redirect is global once enabled, it is applied **only** for
//! platforms that actually need it, and the user's existing options for that
//! core are copied in first so nothing they set is lost.

///
/// A modifier rather than a mode. The previous arrangement put the repeat *on*
/// a face button, which meant either living with a held shot underneath the
/// repeat or remapping the fire button somewhere else — and a game where
/// holding fire means something, like Pulstar's charge shot, cannot survive
/// either. Holding a shoulder is RetroArch's own oldest turbo behaviour and
/// changes nothing about the pad until you ask: hold LB and *then* hold A, and
/// A repeats for as long as both are down. Let go of LB and A is one press,
/// one shot, with nothing remapped and nothing to undo.
///
/// # Why this is one button and not several
///
/// RetroArch 1.20.0 declares the modifier as a single bind —
/// `DECLARE_BIND(turbo, RARCH_TURBO_ENABLE, …)`, written to the config as
/// `input_playerN_turbo{,_btn,_axis,_mbtn}`, which is one *action* offered in
/// four input kinds rather than four buttons. The button it repeats is
/// likewise singular, `input_turbo_default_button`, and the single-button
/// modes enforce that in code with `if (id != remap_button) break;`.
///
/// Several buttons at once is possible in only one place: classic mode, which
/// keeps a bitmask (`turbo_btns.enable[port] |= (1 << id)`) of every button
/// pressed while the modifier is down. That mode is rejected — the bit clears
/// when the *face* button is released rather than the modifier, so letting go
/// of the modifier leaves the game firing, which is the latch this arrangement
/// exists to avoid.
///
/// So: one modifier, chosen from several, rather than several at once.
