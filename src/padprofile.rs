//! Turns a physical gamepad button into the binding RetroArch expects for it.
//!
//! Hotkeys in `retroarch.cfg` (`input_exit_emulator_btn = "0"`) are *raw driver
//! indices*, not the browser's standard-mapping indices and not anything
//! portable. The same Xbox controller reports:
//!
//! | button | macOS (mfi) | Linux (udev) | Windows (dinput) |
//! |--------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
//! | A      | 0           | 0            | 0                |
//! | B      | 8           | 1            | 1                |
//! | Select | 2           | 6            | 6                |
//! | D-pad  | 4..7        | hat `h0up`   | hat `h0up`       |
//! | RT     | axis `+5`   | axis `+5`    | axis `-2`        |
//!
//! So a hardcoded number is wrong on two platforms out of three, and wrong
//! again on the next controller. RetroArch already solves this: it ships an
//! autoconfig profile per controller per driver, mapping raw inputs to the
//! abstract RetroPad. Reading that file and inverting it gives the correct raw
//! binding for whatever is actually plugged in.
//!
//! Note the RetroPad naming is SNES-style, so it does *not* line up with the
//! labels printed on an Xbox pad: RetroPad `b` is the bottom button (Xbox A),
//! RetroPad `a` is the right one (Xbox B). [`Physical`] exists so the rest of
//! the code can say "the A button" and mean the one the user's thumb is on.
