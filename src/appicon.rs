//! Which picture the app itself wears — in the Dock, the taskbar, the switcher.
//!
//! A registry rather than a pair of hardcoded paths, because the point of the
//! setting is that the list grows. Adding an icon is two steps and no logic:
//! drop a 1024x1024 PNG into `assets/appicons/`, add a line to [`ICONS`]. The
//! build script turns every PNG in that folder into the shapes each OS wants
//! without being told which ones exist, and the Settings picker draws whatever
//! this list holds.
//!
//! The id is the PNG's filename without its extension, and it is what goes into
//! `config.toml`. So an id is permanent once shipped: renaming one silently
//! resets everybody who chose it back to the default.
