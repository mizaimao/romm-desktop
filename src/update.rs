//! Is there a newer release than the one running?
//!
//! The app publishes GitHub releases and has never mentioned that any exist, so
//! the only way to find out was to go and look. This asks, and says so once.
//!
//! ## Deliberately not an updater
//!
//! It reports and links; it does not download, replace or restart anything.
//! Self-replacing binaries need code signing, a rollback path and a story for
//! the half-written case, and none of that is worth carrying for a tool one
//! person runs on three machines. Knowing there is a new version is the part
//! that was missing.
//!
//! ## The version scheme is not semver
//!
//! This project counts 0.1.9 -> 0.1.10, and bumps the patch number by however
//! many things a batch contained — 0.2.302 to 0.2.439 is one afternoon.
//! Comparison is therefore numeric per component, never lexicographic: as
//! strings, "0.2.439" sorts before "0.2.99".
