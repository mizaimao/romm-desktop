//! RetroAchievements, delivered through the launch config layer.
//!
//! Nothing here talks to retroachievements.org — RetroArch implements the whole
//! protocol. What this does is own the *configuration*, in this project's
//! `config.toml`, and write it into the per-launch layer.
//!
//! Self-contained on purpose. The credentials are not read from the user's own
//! `retroarch.cfg` and nothing here depends on how RetroArch is set up: the
//! same `config.toml` produces the same achievement behaviour against any
//! RetroArch install, including a fresh one that has never been logged in. That
//! is the same principle as the rest of the launch layer — this app's settings
//! live in this app's config, and the user's emulator settings are left alone.
//!
//! `cheevos_username` is required alongside the credential. RetroArch can hold
//! a token with an empty username, in which case the token authenticates
//! nothing and achievements stay silently off — which is exactly the state this
//! machine's `retroarch.cfg` was in, and precisely why inheriting from it is
//! not something to rely on.
//!
//! ## Hardcore mode
//!
//! `cheevos_hardcore_mode_enable` disables save states, fast-forward and
//! rewind, because those are how you would cheat an achievement. Four of the
//! gamepad hotkeys this app ships are exactly those functions, so turning
//! hardcore on silently breaks Select+LB, Select+RB, Select+RT and the save
//! slot d-pad bindings.
//!
//! It is therefore written explicitly on every launch rather than inherited.
//! An install with `cheevos_hardcore_mode_enable = "true"` sitting in its own
//! config — which is RetroArch's default once you enable achievements — would
//! otherwise take those hotkeys away with no indication why.

/// What the user configured under `[achievements]`.
