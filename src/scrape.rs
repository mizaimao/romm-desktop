//! Filling in artwork for games ES-DE never scraped.
//!
//! ## Why this does not talk to ScreenScraper itself
//!
//! ScreenScraper rejects every request that does not carry a *developer*
//! credential, and those are issued to registered applications, not to people.
//! An account of your own is not enough. So a client like this one has three
//! ways to get art, and only one of them is honest:
//!
//! * Take another application's credential — ES-DE's, say, or RomM's — out of
//!   its binary or its URLs and make our own calls under its name. That is
//!   impersonating someone else's software to a service that trusted it, and
//!   when it is noticed the key is revoked for *their* users, who did nothing.
//!   Not an option, however convenient.
//! * Register this app with ScreenScraper and wait for its own credential.
//!   Correct, and slow.
//! * Ask the server, which already has one.
//!
//! The third is what happens here, and it needs nothing new. A RomM server with
//! ScreenScraper configured answers `/api/search/roms` with ready-made media
//! URLs — the same call and the same URLs its own web interface uses when it
//! offers you match candidates. Fetching one is being an ordinary client of
//! your own server. Nothing is borrowed and nothing is pretended.
//!
//! The full set comes from the same place. A game the server has matched
//! against ScreenScraper carries `ss_metadata`: every media URL it resolved —
//! 2D box, back, 3D box, cartridge, miximage, screenshot, title screen,
//! marquee, fanart, manual, video. Those are the server's own URLs, stored on
//! the server, served back on `/api/roms/{id}`, so reading them is reading your
//! own library. Nothing is assembled here, which is the line that matters:
//! rewriting the `media=` parameter to invent requests the server never made
//! would be the first option wearing a different hat.
//!
//! A game the server matched some other way — IGDB, LaunchBox, or nothing — has
//! no `ss_metadata`, and then all that is available is the single 2D box URL
//! the search endpoint builds on demand. So the result is uneven by design, and
//! honest about which games got what.
//!
//! ## Where the art goes
//!
//! Into the same local cache the ES-DE tree is copied to, each type filed under
//! the ES-DE directory that means the same thing — so a scraped game is
//! indistinguishable from one ES-DE scraped, and the art chain, the card
//! sizing and the info pane all work on it without knowing where it came from.
