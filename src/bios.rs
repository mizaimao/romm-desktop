//! black or shows a line about a missing file, and nothing says which file or
//! where it should go.
//!
//! RomM keeps the BIOS set alongside the games, which is the point — the same
//! server that has the ROMs has the files needed to run them, so a second
//! machine is one sync away rather than a manual hunt.
//!
//! Everything lands flat in `<library>/system/`, not in the folders the server
//! groups them under. RetroArch looks in exactly one directory and does not
//! recurse, so `bios/3do/panafz1.bin` on the server has to become
//! `system/panafz1.bin` here.
