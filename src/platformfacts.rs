//! What each console is, in a sentence.
//!
//! ES-DE's themes carry this: pick a system and the screen tells you who made
//! it, when it arrived, whether it is a console, a handheld or a cabinet, and
//! a line about what it was. The library here had none of it — a console was a
//! name, a picture and a number, and everything else about it lived in
//! Settings.
//!
//! A table in the binary rather than a file to ship: it is thirty lines of
//! facts that have not changed in twenty years, and a file is one more thing
//! to find, parse and fail to find.
//!
//! Release years are the *first* release anywhere, which is what ES-DE uses
//! and is the only unambiguous choice — the Mega Drive is 1988 in Japan, 1989
//! in America and 1990 in Europe, and picking the local one means the answer
//! depends on who is reading.

/// One console, as the preview pane shows it.
