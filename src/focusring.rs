// Reaching everything on a screen with a direction pad.
//
// The cursor today walks a list, because a list is a column of identical boxes
// and "the next one" is obvious. Everything that is not a list — the tab row,
// the buttons in the header, the sort and filter menus, the settings window —
// is reachable only with a mouse. On a desktop that is fine. On an Android
// handheld there is no pointer at all, so anything the pad cannot reach may as
// well not be drawn: see `docs/parked.md`.
//
// So this is the other half of navigation. Given where everything is on the
// screen, it answers "if I press left from here, what should light up" for
// every thing on it at once — a table, computed when the screen is drawn and
// then walked without asking again, which is the same bargain `gridnav` makes
// and for the same reason (`docs/handheld-frontend.md`: nothing per keypress
// crosses a boundary).
//
// `gridnav` is not this. It assumes a wall of equal cards in rows and answers
// in rows and columns. A screen is not a grid: a tab is 90 points wide beside
// one that is 40, the preview column is one tall box beside eighty small ones,
// and there is no row that contains both.
