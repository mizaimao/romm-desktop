//! Deterministic "does this core actually run this game?" test.
//!
//! The previous attempt at this launched a game, waited a few seconds, killed
//! it, and called it a pass if nothing had crashed. That gave contradictory
//! results on identical runs — the same game passed three times and failed a
//! fourth — and a default was once changed on the strength of it. None of that
//! evidence was worth anything.
//!
//! This is the honest version, built on three RetroArch features:
//!
//! * `--max-frames=N` runs exactly N frames and exits. No timers, no killing.
//! * `--log-file` + `--verbose` record what the core actually did.
//! * null audio and video drivers keep it quiet and stop it rendering.
//!
//! It is **not** headless, though. `video_driver = "null"` silences rendering,
//! but on macOS RetroArch's Cocoa frontend creates its window before the video
//! driver is chosen, so a window still appears for every probe. Probing N games
//! against M cores opens N*M windows, so this is gated behind an explicit flag
//! and never run unasked.
//!
//! **The exit code is 0 whether or not the content loaded**, which is the trap
//! the old method fell into. The verdict comes from the log alone.
