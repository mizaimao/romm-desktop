// What a list of games knows about itself: the row shape, which view it is,

// server which games are downloaded is a filter that is slow on the console
// that needs it most — arcade, at 2,506 games.
//
// See [`crate::gamesort`] for the orders and [`crate::gamefilter`] for the
// filters. Both are driven from here.
