//!
//! `config.example.toml` is the file the release notes tell a new user to copy,
//! and until this module existed nothing ever read it. A renamed field, a value
//! the app rejects, or a comment offering a setting that does not exist would
//! all reach a user before anyone noticed — and two did: the template
//! documented `list_art = "cartridge"` and `motion = "strobe"`, and neither is
//! a value the app accepts.
//!
//! So every value either file sets is checked against the code that consumes
//! it, and so is every alternative their comments offer.
//!
//! The template is compiled in; `config.toml` is *read from disk* instead. It
//! holds a server token, and `include_str!` would bake that into every binary.
