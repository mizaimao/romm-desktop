// The arcade console holds 2,506 games. Sorting them is not the same as
// finding one: "by rating" still leaves 2,506 rows, and the eleven you have
// actually played are somewhere in it.
//
// Built out of what a row already carries — downloaded, starred, rated, its
// year, whether it has ever been played — so nothing has to be fetched and the
// filtering is instant on a list of any size. Genre is missing on purpose: the
// RomM browse tab is genres, done properly, as collections from the server.
