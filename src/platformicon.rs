//! Console pictures for the platform grid, taken from your own RomM server.
//!
//! RomM ships a drawing of every console it knows about and serves them at
//! `/assets/platforms/<slug>.svg` — a 1000x1000 illustration of the actual
//! hardware, not the system's name set as type. They need no authentication,
//! they are already on a machine on this network, and being vector art they
//! stay sharp at whatever size the grid is zoomed to.
//!
//! This is why the app no longer asks anyone to download an ES-DE theme to get
//! pictures on the platform cards. A theme is a few hundred megabytes fetched
//! from a stranger's git host to obtain art that the server we are already
//! talking to hands over in a few kilobytes each.
//!
//! Not every platform has one. The server had 28 of 35 when this was written —
//! `saturn`, `sms`, `naomi`, `famicom`, `pico`, `g-and-w` and `easyrpg` were
//! missing. Those fall back to the styled name, so a gap is a plain-looking
//! card rather than an empty one.
//!
//! ## Which slug
//!
//! Two different slugs are in play and they do not always agree: RomM's own
//! (`sms`, `genesis`, `sfam`) and the folder name the files live under
//! (`mastersystem`, `megadrive`, `sfc`). The icons are published under the
//! first; everything else in this app keys off the second. So the fetch reads
//! RomM's slug and the file is *saved* under the folder name, and no later
//! lookup has to know that the two ever differed.
