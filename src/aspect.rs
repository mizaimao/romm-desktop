//! What shape each console's picture is.
//!
//! A window that does not match gets black bars, and on a maximised window
//! those bars are large — a Game Boy Advance is 3:2 and a modern laptop screen
//! is nearer 16:10, so a full-height window leaves a black column down each
//! side that is wider than the game is tall on the original hardware.
//!
//! RetroArch cannot fix that from inside: it is told to keep the picture's
//! shape, so all it can do is put bars in the space it was given. The fix is to
//! give it less space, of the right shape.
//!
//! These are the *display* aspects, not the pixel counts. A SNES frame is
//! 256x224, which is 8:7, and it was meant to be seen on a 4:3 television —
//! using the pixel count would make every game on the system slightly too tall.
//! Handhelds are the other way round: their pixels really are square, because
//! the panel was part of the machine.
