//! Syncing, as a state machine the interface can draw.
//!
//! Nothing here talks to the network. The worker thread does that and hands
//! back one of these states; keeping the two apart is what lets the whole of
//! the behaviour — including "the server said conflict" — be tested without a
//! server.
//!
//! The shape is fixed by one rule: **nothing moves until the plan has been
//! shown and accepted.** `negotiate` tells us what would happen before a byte
//! is transferred, so there is no reason to act first and report afterwards,
//! and every reason not to on a device whose only copy of a save is local.
//!
//! The plan itself — [`Action`], [`Line`], [`Review`] — moved to
//! `romm_desktop::syncplan` when the desktop and Android app grew the same
//! review step. Both frontends show one plan and it is sorted and phrased in
//! one place; two copies of "which order do the rows go in" is two copies that
//! can disagree about which save you were looking at. Re-exported here so this
//! module still reads as the whole of syncing from the addon's side.
