//! `moose-fastlaunch` — start a game without waiting for Python.
//!
//! Measured on the Flip, 2026-08-28: a warm GBA launch is 4.26 s, of which
//! RetroArch is 0.83 s and `configgen` is 3.43 s. That 3.43 s is 272 Python
//! files imported from cold on every launch (1.08 s), a daemon restarted and
//! waited on for no reason (0.93 s), and about 1.4 s of config work.
//!
//! This program does the config work natively for the twelve libretro systems
//! that are actually played here, and hands everything else back.
//!
//! # The safety story
//!
//! There is exactly one: **when in doubt, exec the Python launcher.** An
//! unknown system, a non-libretro emulator, a core that is not on disk, a
//! `knulli.conf` that will not parse — all of them end in
//! [`fall_back`], which costs the 3.4 s we were trying to save and is
//! otherwise indistinguishable from not having installed this at all.
//!
//! # What is not done yet
//!
//! Generating `retroarchcustom.cfg`. That file is 114 KB and about 3,200
//! lines, and reproducing it exactly is the bulk of the remaining work. It is
//! deliberately not guessed at here: `--plan` prints what this program has
//! resolved so it can be diffed against what configgen decided, and the
//! generation lands only once that diff is clean across every system. Until
//! then this binary resolves and falls back, which is correct but not yet
//! fast. See `docs/fast-launch.md`.
