# Two steps, because `resources/esde-media` on the server is owned by root and
# sudo there wants a password. Step one needs neither: it lands in your own home
# directory over SSH. Step two moves it into place as root, and is left for you
# to run.

# --ignore-existing rather than --update: every file here is a copy of a file on
# the card, so anything already on the server is already the same bytes, and
# re-sending 90 GB to prove it is not worth the wire time.
#
# The dot-files are this app's own bookkeeping — the negative-lookup index, the
# scraped manifest, the cache-cleared marker. They are about this machine and
# mean nothing on the server.

Step two, when you are ready. This is the one that needs root, and it is done
through docker because you are in the docker group and sudo is not open:

  ssh $HOST
  docker run --rm -v /home/frank:/h alpine \\
    sh -c 'cp -rn /h/esde-staging/. $LIVE/ && echo done'

  # then, once the app shows the art, reclaim the space:
  rm -rf $STAGING

-n keeps anything already on the server: the copy only adds. Both paths are on
the same disk, so it is fast and needs no second 90 GB.
