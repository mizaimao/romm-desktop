# macOS is deliberately absent from the release workflow. A CI-built bundle is
# unsigned, so it arrives quarantined: the user has to mount a disk image, drag
# the app out, then clear com.apple.quarantine before it will open. Building on
# the machine that runs it skips all of that — a locally-produced bundle carries
# no quarantine attribute at all.
#
#   ./scripts/build-macos.sh            build, place the bundle in the repo root
#   ./scripts/build-macos.sh --link     also symlink it into ~/Applications/MooseStack
#   ./scripts/build-macos.sh --cli      build only the command-line binary
