#   romm-launch.sh            EmulationStation started us, as a Port. ES has
#                             already dropped the display and is waiting on us.
#   romm-launch.sh --hotkey   triggerhappy started us, on L2+R2. Nobody dropped
#                             anything, so we have to stop ES ourselves.
#
# The difference is only who owns the screen. ES holds DRM master and lets go
# for children it launches itself; nothing launched from outside gets that, so
# the hotkey path has to stop ES and put it back afterwards.
