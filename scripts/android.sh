Gone. Everything this script installed lived in .toolchain/android/ inside the
project — its own JDK, its own SDK and NDK, its own Gradle home, its own rustup
and cargo homes, and a redirected HOME to catch anything that had other ideas.

Nothing was written to ~/.gradle, ~/.android, ~/Library/Android, ~/.rustup,
~/.cargo, /usr/local or /opt/homebrew.

To check for yourself:  ls -la ~/.gradle ~/.android ~/Library/Android 2>&1
