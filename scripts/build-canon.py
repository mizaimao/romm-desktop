"""Build a per-platform want-list by consensus across published rankings.

One list is one outlet's opinion. Two agreeing is a signal. The first attempt at
this ranked by the `<rating>` values in a drive's own gamelist.xml — scraper
scores of unknown provenance, a number attached to a file rather than a
judgement anyone stands behind — and produced something that looked
authoritative and was not.

So: several rankings per system, and a game's score is how many of them list it.
Anything appearing on one list alone is kept but marked, because a single
mention is exactly what consensus is supposed to filter.

Sources are the ones that actually serve their content to a plain HTTP client.
Several well-known outlets do not, and a source that cannot be read is not a
source. Each has its own markup, so each gets its own extractor rather than one
clever regex that silently half-works.
