Gone. Everything this script installed lived in .toolchain/ inside the project,
including its own copy of rustc — nothing was written to ~/.rustup, /usr/local,
/opt/homebrew or ~/.cargo/bin. What is left on this machine that was not here
before is downloaded crates in ~/.cargo/registry, which every build in this
project already shares.

To check for yourself:  ls ~/.rustup/toolchains
