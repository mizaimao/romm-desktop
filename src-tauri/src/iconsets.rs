//! The Icon sets tab: preview an ES-DE theme's console artwork before fetching it.
//!
//! Every theme in the official ES-DE list that carries per-system artwork —
//! 54 of the 65. The other eleven draw a console's frontend rather than its
//! systems, so there is nothing here for them to offer.
//!
//! The list comes from `romm_desktop::iconart`, keyed by the same `reponame`
//! the published themes list uses, so the two join on a key rather than by
//! matching names.
//!
//! ## What a preview shows
//!
//! The set's own console pictures, fetched one file at a time straight from
//! the theme's repository — see `romm_desktop::iconart`. Not the author's
//! screenshots, which is what this tab did first and which turned out to be
//! misleading: a screenshot is a picture of the theme's *interface*, and the
//! interface is the one part of a theme this app never installs.
//!
//! ## Sets against the shared pool
//!
//! `fetch_icons` fills `_platforms/<style>/` from four themes at once, taking
//! the best available picture of each kind for each console. A set instead
//! keeps one designer's work together under `_platforms/sets/<set>/<style>/`.
//! Both exist; `icons.set` chooses between them, and a set with no picture for
//! some console falls through to the pool rather than leaving a hole.
