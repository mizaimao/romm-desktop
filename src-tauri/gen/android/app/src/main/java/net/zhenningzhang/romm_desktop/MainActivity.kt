     * drawn for it — `?android:attr/selectableItemBackground`, a ripple, painted
     * over the view's whole bounds. It appears only once the window leaves touch
     * mode, and a d-pad or stick press is exactly what does that; a fresh launch
     * is in touch mode, which is why the first frames look right. Re-entering
     * touch mode does not undo it, because the drawable is only chosen when
     * focus changes.
     *
     * The colour is arithmetic rather than a guess. `colorControlHighlight` in a
     * night-mode Material theme is #33FFFFFF — twenty per cent of white — and
     * `RippleBackground.FOCUSED_ALPHA` is 0.6, so what lands is twelve per cent
     * of white. Measured on the device: the page painted #000000 came out
     * #1F1F1F, and 0.12 * 255 = 30.6, which is 0x1F.
     *
     * Everything that made this hard to find follows from *where* it is drawn.
     * It is a View foreground, so it goes on after Chromium has finished: the
     * page cannot see it, `getComputedStyle` reports the colour the stylesheet
     * asked for, and no background anywhere in the app — page, webview, window,
     * theme — is underneath it. It is inside the app's own raster, so
     * SurfaceFlinger reports the layer as opaque with an identity colour
     * transform. And it covers the view's bounds, so it lands on the canvas and
     * the artwork too, at which point the whole screen has a floor: measured
     * across 1920x1080, one pixel out of 2,073,600 was darker than #1F1F1F.
     *
     * The one number that ever argued against "something white on top" was
     * #FF0000 coming out #EA3D31, which no white overlay produces. That was the
     * capture, not the app: `screencap` reads back in Display-P3, and twelve per
     * cent of white over red, converted to P3, is (234, 61, 49) exactly.
     *
     * There is nothing in this app for the highlight to be useful to — one
     * webview, filling the window, and every focus ring the user sees is drawn
     * by the page.
